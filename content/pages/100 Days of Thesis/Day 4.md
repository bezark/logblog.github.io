Reflecting on

  + [Many Worlds Game/version/1]({{< ref "Many Worlds Game/version/1" >}}) playtest

    + [Many Worlds Game/version/1]({{< ref "Many Worlds Game/version/1" >}}) #game/dev/playtest


      + I thougt this went well. Definitely learned a fair amount

      + The game was very mechanical. very [[engine builder]] ey. This pulled away from the [[roleplaying]]  that I had hoped to cultivate

        + I think there was SOME, but there could have been more for sure.

      + [[Benny]] said this was in part a thing that came from the dact that they were just thinking about how to maximize the card pull. This makes sense. They were in an optimizing mode.

      + there wasn't a sense of time flowing.

        + It felt like we were still in the early days of a scoiety.

        + History was just starting out

  + Process so far

    + Made a template

      + Reflection Template

    + I have been very analytical lately

      + lost in a land of links and templates, cards upgrades abilities and deckbuilding

        + nothing i can't emerge from, but certainly a way of thinking

      + I feel like i'm trying to think my way out of certain imaginary problems.

      + And coming to coherence is not trivial.

      + It's realyl easy for [[system]] to eclipse the funciton. [[Systemantics]] etc.

      + 

    + However, I DID make a somewhat playable game for the first time in a while and I tested it.

    + It also feels like I am moving too slowly, but perhaps that's good.

      + what's the rush? Arbitrary deadlines? expectations? Let them go.

    + Things to try in future iterations

      + Make a [[Larp]]

        + a big thing with a lot of people

      + Set aside cards

      + Play with media?

      + bring in more [[models]] from [[The Atlas of Forecasts]]

    + What actually is a a begining?
 is also a very good question  #ttt

      + You cant really start from nowhere. Perhaps all [[civilization]] [[stories]] come from previous histories.

      + You can create a [[mythology]] about the world to explain a cosmology and a history could be forgotton, but everyone gets born INTO a world that already exists.

    + The idea of having different game modes:
      + engine building

      + storytelling and roleplaying

      + exploration

      + territory capture

    + These modes could be different ROLES or different PHASES.
    + And there ought to be either different types of cards OR **different ways of interpreting the cards.**
      + _I imagined a different pattern of cards- one that was grid like and strategic, one that was circular and interpretive.... This sort of  turned into Value/social structure is almost a meta level
 _ #commentary

    + And benny's idea that certain cards could emerge as ther result of narrative choices.

      + Like what if the cards were earned by the story.

  + I fee lik there is room for alternative structures

    + there are cards that simply tell stories.

    + Cards that help you imagine a situation

      + Thinking about [[Tarot]] . saw a good tweet #card

        + > The best oracles are assembled from very carefully curated ingredients... dense layered symbol networks that dare you to project meaning.

  + Next Game  [[Many Worlds Game/archive]]

    + Players interpet cards and tell stories.

      + Perhaps combine three to create an era

    + Simple elegant cards
      + Evocative and underexplained

      + State of the World

        + Complex

        + Precarious

        + Growth

        + Collapse

        + Transformation

        + Revolutiion

        + Decline

        + Rebirth

    + A large amount of time and scale is coverend

    + There are different Modes of play
      + The idea of having different game modes:


    + Questions:

      + How can I cultivate narrative freedom while also having mechanical structures that make it gmless?

      + Can i get a sense of time passing?

      + Can I find different modes of play?

    + Plans

      + Make interpretive cards (barinstorm)

    +
