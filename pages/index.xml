This is a blog of sorts. It&amp;rsquo;s also a place to wander around. Really it&amp;rsquo;s a Digital Gardens

There is a lot of good thinking on them over here on the Digital Gardeners Repo. [[Maggie Appleton]], prolific digital gardener and originator of the above repository, has written an excellent primer on the etymology and history of digital gardens. Here are one notable excerpts describing the concept:
Digital Gardens are not following the same conventions as what we&amp;rsquo;ve come to know as the &amp;ldquo;personal blog&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Futures</title><link>https://logblog.github.io/pages/futures/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://logblog.github.io/pages/futures/</guid><description/></item><item><title>LogSeq P5 Page Word Cloud</title><link>https://logblog.github.io/pages/logseq-p5-page-word-cloud/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://logblog.github.io/pages/logseq-p5-page-word-cloud/</guid><description>What I decided to go for though was simply getting a wordcloud into a p5 plugin from my [[Logseq]] page entries. Clicking the graph button creates a word cloud for all times I&amp;rsquo;ve linked to that page. That&amp;rsquo;s really nice because in logseq, essentially anything can be a page, and I have a lot of pages for specific parts of my life:

Many Worlds Card Sheet Figma Notes
First idea
What if there was some sort of game that was sort of like a tarrot deck, sort of like a trading card game, sort of like a world building rpg where you played driving forces, events or things from your hand and used them to shape the history of a world and imagine it&amp;rsquo;s future?</description></item><item><title>Player Indigo Games</title><link>https://logblog.github.io/pages/player-indigo-games/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://logblog.github.io/pages/player-indigo-games/</guid><description>Howdy! Here&amp;rsquo;s all the versions of the game I&amp;rsquo;m making for the [[Player Indigo Residency]]
I&amp;rsquo;m using this as a chance to really develop my [[itp/Thesis]] and I&amp;rsquo;m walking into this trying to make an iteration of a Many Worlds Game
Namely I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make:
A divination tool and deck building cardgame for embodying pasts, imagining futures and articulating alternate civilizations
I want to create a divination deck or collaborative storytelling ttrpg with cardbased deck building that helps players tell the story of an entire civilization in single sitting.</description></item></channel></rss>
